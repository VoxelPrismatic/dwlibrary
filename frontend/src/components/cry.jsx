                <br /> My position on the subject of men crying as i mentioned
                yesterday i tweeted that men should not cry in public because
                it's dishonorable and unmanly though i allow for certain
                exceptions which i have outlined in further detail in the past
                um perhaps i should publish an official list you know with an
                index and a glossary and a bibliography and everything so that
                any man if he's considering crying can quickly consult the rule
                book and find out if he's if his upcoming sobbing fit meets the
                requirements you know is this going to be sanctioned crying or
                not but that's a project for another day

                <br /> <br /> Throw the bowl of chili go to somebody's house and
                this has happened to me before you go to somebody's house and
                they say oh we're having chili and you say oh wow this makes my
                day and then they serve you the bowl of chili but then you
                discover that the chili is made with ground turkey and black
                beans then it's it's acceptable actually to throw the the hot
                bowl of chili at the person who served it to you and cry and
                that's acceptable not only morally and ethically but also
                legally I believe that's the the law stipulates that I pretty
                sure in most states anyway those are the seven times
