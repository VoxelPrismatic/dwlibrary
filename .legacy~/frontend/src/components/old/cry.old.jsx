                On Episode 763 Matt Walsh cancelled democrat politicians
                specifially men for crying. Below is a quote from Matt's show on

              <br /> My position on the subject of men crying as i mentioned
              yesterday i tweeted that men should not cry in public because it's
              dishonorable and unmanly though i allow for certain exceptions
              which i have outlined in further detail in the past um perhaps i
              should publish an official list you know with an index and a
              glossary and a bibliography and everything so that any man if he's
              considering crying can quickly consult the rule book and find out
              if he's if his upcoming sobbing fit meets the requirements you
              know is this going to be sanctioned crying or not but that's a
              project for another day
